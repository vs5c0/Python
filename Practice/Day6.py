# String Indexing ---> used to extract the particular character in a String

# Positive indexing
string = "Vikram Aditya"
string1 = string[2]
print(string1)

# Negative indexing
stri = "Vikram Aditya"
string2 = stri[-2]
print(string2)

# Example Program
Name = "Vikram"
five = Name[-1]
four = Name[-2]
Three = Name[-3]
Two = Name[-4]
one = Name[-5]
zero = Name[-6]
print(five)
print(four)
print(Three)
print(Two)
print(one)
print(zero)

# Slicing in Python
# Slicling --> is a Process of extract the particular portion of a String

# Example Program
Names = "Sai Ram"
sub = Names[0:4]
print(sub)

# Example program 2
Navy = "Indian"
subs = Navy[0:5]
print(subs)


# 1 Extract  First character of a String
suns = "The sun is shining"
moon = suns[0]
print(moon)

# 2 Extract  last character of a String
sunss = "She sells seashells by the seashore."
moons = sunss[-1]
print(moons)

# 3 Extract the  character at the index 3

uns = "I love Python!"
oons = uns[3]
print(oons)

# 4 Extract the last character at the sentence

unss = "Life is beautiful."
oonss = unss[-2]
print(oonss)

# 5 Extract the substring form index 7 to 14

input = "Welcome to Python Programming"
s = input[7:14]
print(s)

# 6 Extract the substring form index -9 to -3

inputs = "The future is bright."
s1 = inputs[-9:-3]
print(s1)

# 7 Extract the first six characters of a Sentence

Inp = "Good things take time"
s2 = Inp[0:6]
print(s2)


# 8 Reverse the sentence Using Slicing

Insps = "Python is awesome!"
Sao = Insps[-1:12]
print(Sao)

# Length of a String using index

Form = "Coding is fun!"
print(len(Form))
